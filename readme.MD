# Project Suphra Bot

Suphra is a robot built on top of a $25 RC car purchased from a Target store. I started this project in the year 2016 to help me learn about robotics. The goal was to assemble a Raspberry Pi 2 as the brain of the robot on the car chassis, using the Raspberry Pi to send controlling commands through an H-Bridge to the servo for steering and to the main motor for acceleration. I also incorporated an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance from obstacles and adjust the course accordingly. I successfully assembled and wired everything. However, due to my limited research on different types of motors, the final product didn't have precise control over its speed. For instance, the car would accelerate too quickly and couldn't stop in time to avoid obstacles.

Fast forward to 2023, I decided to return to my robotics endeavors and resume work on this project. I wrote the code for controlling the car from scratch using Python, without relying on any libraries. This time, I plan to implement ROS (Robot Operating System). I believe there is still some room for improvement before I completely abandon the DC motor as the power train. I will move the code for the older versions to the archive directory.
